This file does data augmentation to balance the class


1) A "label" (class 0–3)

2) Frame-wise "pose" keypoints (flattened x and y coordinates)

3) Counts how many samples exist per class.

For each class:

4) If it already has at least 112 samples, nothing is added.

5) If it has fewer than 112 samples, the script:

6) Randomly selects existing samples from that class.

7) Adds small Gaussian noise (~2%) to each pose keypoint.

8) Saves the new (augmented) sample with a new filename (e.g., sample_3_aug5.json).

9) Saves all original + augmented JSON files into preprocessing/augmented_skeletons.

10) Creates an updated augment_label.pkl file, which stores:

11) A list of all (sample_name, label) tuples — used by the data feeder during model training.
